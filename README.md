# n-ary-tree
Traversing an n-ary tree considering the tree as basically a graph, just to remove the complications based on the name "trees"\
traversal is done in level_order and the output is the sum of nodes at each level for a n-ary tree.
# There are two functions implemented..
1) done using queues.
2) done using unordered_maps.
